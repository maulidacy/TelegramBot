How to Configure NetBeans to Include the Dataset Folder in the Jar:

1. Open your NetBeans IDE and load your project.

2. Right-click on your project name in the "Projects" pane and select "Properties".

3. In the Project Properties window, select the "Sources" category.

4. Under "Source Package Folders", click the "Add Folder..." button.

5. Navigate to your "dataset" folder (the folder containing your JSON files) and select it.

6. Click "Open" to add it as a source folder. This will make NetBeans treat it as a resource folder.

7. Click "OK" to close the Project Properties window.

8. Perform a "Clean and Build" on your project (Right-click project > Clean and Build).

9. After the build completes, check the generated jar file (usually in the "dist" folder) to verify that the "dataset" folder and its JSON files are included inside the jar.

10. Run your jar file again. The resource loading should now find the JSON files inside the jar, and your bot should display recipe details correctly.

Alternative Method (Editing project.properties):

1. Open the file "nbproject/project.properties" in your project directory.

2. Add or modify the following line to include the dataset folder in the jar:

   dist.jar.includes=dataset/**

3. Save the file.

4. Clean and build your project again.

5. Verify the jar contents and run the jar.

This configuration ensures that the dataset folder and its contents are packaged inside the jar, allowing your code to load the JSON resources correctly when running from the jar.
